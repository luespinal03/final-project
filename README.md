# Final Project

Our final project is a Reject version of a recreation of mySpace 
you can create and populate your own account

Luis and I have our own accounts made where we can each individually log in to our own pages.

Each account has an embedded song from spotify. 

Each page is equipped with an area where the user is able to write their status and post it in the area below. Current posted status will be replaced by the new incoming status once its posted.
